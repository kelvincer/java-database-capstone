This is the final project of the course "IBM Java Developer". I am using Spring Boot. For UI I am using Thymeleaf which it is conected to Controller, which uses Services and Repositories. We will interact with Mysql database and MongoDB database.
This final capstone project is divided in 5 modules, where in each module we will developed the project step by step.

1. User accesses AdminDashboard or Appointment pages.
2. The action is routed to the appropriate Thymeleaf or REST controller.
3. The controller calls the service layer.
4. The service calls the repository.
5. The repository interacts with Mysql and Mongodb database.
6. Database data will be convert to JPA entities and document objects.
7. Thymeleaf is rendered by a browser. REST services send response to clients as HTTP response.
